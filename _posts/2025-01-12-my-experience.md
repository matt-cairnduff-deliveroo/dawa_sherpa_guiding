## I have been working as a mountaineering and trekking guide for over 11 years, with experience in mountaineering, ice climbing, and trekking in high mountain areas.

### Experience
- Recognized guide training from the Government of Nepal
- A member of the [Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA)](https://www.nepalmountaineering.org/home).
- I have climbed Mount Everest twice (8,849 m), holding the record for [the first volleyball referee to reach the summit](https://www.fivb.com/volleyball-reaches-new-heights-at-the-peak-of-mount-everest)!
- Extensive experience scaling many other mountains across the Himalayas, including:
  - Lobuche Peak (6,119 m)
