## Welcome to Dawa Sherpa guiding.

Hi, I'm Dawa Tshering ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a mountaineering and trekking guide with 11 years of exeprience based in Nepal. I was born in a small village in Solukhumbu district and grew up in the mountains. My father was also a mountaineering guide and he inspired me to pursueÂ thisÂ career. I look forward to sharing this knowledge with other adventurers!
